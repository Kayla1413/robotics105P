## Robotics using ActivityBot
**COMP105P accomplishments while at UCL**
```
Code explained below are optimized for the simulator NOT for the actual robot
```
1. First file contains phase 1 of the final project. It has a wall following algorithm and stores neccessary variables
2. Second file contains phase 2.It uses information gathered from phase 1 to run Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path

Note that this assumes a 4 x 4 grid of 40 - 60cm sided squares
